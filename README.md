- **TMDB API**: To fetch movie data such as posters, titles, and details.
- **Dart**: The programming language used for Flutter development.
- **HTTP Package**: To handle API requests and fetch data from TMDB.

## üìù API Setup

This project uses the **TMDB API** to fetch movie data. You can obtain your own API key by signing up at [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api).

Once you have the API key:
1. Replace the placeholder API key in the project code with your actual key.
2. For example, you can add the following in your code where API calls are made:
    ```dart
    String apiKey = 'YOUR_TMDB_API_KEY';
    ```
